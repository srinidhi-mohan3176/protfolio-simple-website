# 🎨 Welcome to My Simple Portfolio Website

Hello and welcome! 👋  
This repository contains my **very first portfolio website**, designed using just **HTML** and **basic CSS**. It includes a clean and simple **Home** page and a **Contact** page to showcase how I’m starting my journey into web development.

Whether you're here to see my progress or looking for a beginner-friendly example, I hope you find something useful!
